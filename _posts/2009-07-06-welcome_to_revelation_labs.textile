First, let me introduce the development and design culture we've started here at <a href="http://www.revelationglobal.com">Revelation</a>.  We practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">eXtreme Programming</a> or XP.  We believe in short iterations and continually delivering business value in the form of working software.  We believe in testing, or more specifically, in writing tests <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">first</a>. We believe in the tremendous value that interaction design brings to a product.

In short, we are very proud of our work, our process, and our people, and the community that has inspired us.

This is our effort to share what we have learned, and to contribute back to the larger community of developers and thinkers that make our work an expression of the joy of creation.
